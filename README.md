Llama3.1 Chatbot with Groq and Streamlit

This repository provides a simple yet powerful chat application powered by Llama3.1, Groq, and Streamlit. It allows users to interact with the AI model in real-time, leveraging Groq's efficient computation capabilities and Streamlit's user-friendly interface.

Installation

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can check by running python --version in your terminal.

Install Dependencies: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory. Run the following command to install the required libraries: Â  

Bash
pip install streamlit groq
Use code with caution.

Configuration

Create config.json: Locate your project directory and create a new file named config.json. This file will store your Groq API key.

Paste Groq API Key: Open config.json using a text editor and paste your Groq API key inside the following structure:

JSON
{
  "groq_api_key": "YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY"
}
Use code with caution.

Replace "YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY" with your actual Groq API key obtained from the Groq platform.

Running the Chatbot

Start the Application: Once you've installed the dependencies and configured the API key, navigate back to your terminal and execute the following command to launch the chatbot:

Bash
streamlit run main.py
Use code with caution.

This will open the Streamlit app in your default web browser, typically at http://localhost:8501.

Usage

The chatbot interface will appear in your web browser. Simply type your questions or prompts into the text box at the bottom of the chat window and press Enter or click the "Send" button to receive responses from the Llama3.1 model. The chat history will be displayed above, allowing you to track your conversation with the AI.

Additional Notes

Model Customization (Optional): If you want to customize the Llama3.1 model used within the application, you can modify the configuration settings in your code (e.g., main.py). Refer to the Llama3 and Groq documentation for details.
Error Handling: While the provided code should handle most common errors, you may want to implement additional error handling mechanisms for a more robust user experience.
Deployment (Optional): For production deployment, consider using cloud platforms like Heroku or AWS to host your Streamlit application.
